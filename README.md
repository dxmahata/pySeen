About:###

(From The Website) Seen is a new way to organize the real-time web. Our SeenRank algorithm makes stories accessible by capturing the pulse of the crowd to reveal what’s important. Think PageRank but for Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Youtube and more. We alert users to what’s trending and noteworthy in quick summaries.

Smartphones and feeds have created global stories that move at lightning speed. But finding the signal in all that noise can be hard. Seen will be the first place to experience stories as they unfold by harnessing real-time ranking algorithms, data analysis, and beautiful visual design. Our core mission is to help people understand and connect deeply with the world's myriad stories.
